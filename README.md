# red--blue-ratio-method-retrieve-aod
A method to tetrieve aod from remote sensing data of visible bands.It is based on the ratio of  surface reflectance ratio,similiar to the method suggested in Shobha Kondragunta's paper"An enhanced VIIRS aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrieval algorithm over land using a global surface reflectance ratio database".In this program ,i only use the data from mosdis.If you want more detail information ,contact me through e-mail 919487406@qq.com.
